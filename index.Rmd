# Ripple Effects of Climate Change

## Header 2: some background and context 

## Research Questions

The questions we plan to investigate are the following:

1. Bella's question
2. Mythili's question
3. Lillian's question

### Header 3

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For example, you can include **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text.  For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You should test out updating your GitHub Pages website:

- clone your group's blog project repo in RStudio
- update "Your Project Title Here" to a new title in the YAML header
- knit `index.Rmd` 
- commit and push BOTH the `index.Rmd` and the `index.html` files
- go to https://stat231-f20.github.io/Blog-HealthAndJusticeLeague to see the published test document (this is publicly available!)

## Including code and plots

You can embed code as normal, for example:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Let's clean up the format of that output:

```{r pretty, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
summary(cars) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Speed", "Distance")
        , row.names = F) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped"
                , full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, underline = T) %>%
  column_spec(1:2, width = "1.5in") 
```

In a study from the 1920s, fifty cars were used to see how the speed of the car and the distance taken to stop were related.  Speeds ranged between `r min(cars$speed)` and `r max(cars$speed)` mph.  Distances taken to stop ranged between `r min(cars$dist)` and `r max(cars$dist)` feet, with the middle 50% falling between `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[2])` and `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[4])` feet.  

You can also embed plots as normal, for example:

```{r figure1, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Speed of car (mph)"
       , y = "Distance taken to stop (ft)"
       , title = "cars data (1920s)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Including links and images

You can include [Links](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/) and images ![team logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stat231-f20/Blog-HealthAndJusticeLeague/main/images/ph_sj1-7.png)


## Bulleted list

You can make a bulleted list like this:

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3


## Numbered list

You can make a numbered list like this

1. First thing I want to say
2. Second thing I want to say
3. Third thing I want to say


# Tab 1: Bella's part



# Tab 2: Mythili's part

```{r, warning = FALSE}

path_mythili <- "C:/Users/seshu/Documents/RStudio/projects/git/Blog-HealthAndJusticeLeague/data"

#loading data
data_cluster1980s <- read_csv(paste0(path_mythili,"/wrangled_infmatmortcluster1980s.csv")) %>%
  mutate_at(c("avginfmort", "avmatmort"), funs(`std`=scale(.) %>% as.vector()))

#making cluster reproducible, setting number of clusters
set.seed(23)
km_out <- kmeans(data_cluster1980s[,c("avginfmort_std", "avmatmort_std")], centers=4, nstart=20)

```

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

#vector of cluster assignments
km_out$cluster

# add cluster assignment to the data frame
cluster1980s <- data_cluster1980s %>%
  mutate(clust = as.character(km_out$cluster))

```

```{r, warning = FALSE}

# visualize the cluster assignments and centroids
ggplot(data = cluster1980s, aes(x = avginfmort_std, y = avmatmort_std)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = clust)) +
  #geom_text_repel(aes(label= `Country`, color = clust), size = 3) +
  coord_fixed() +
  geom_point(data = as.data.frame(km_out$centers)
             , aes(x = avginfmort_std, y = avmatmort_std)
             , pch = "X"
             , size = 4) +
  labs(x = "Average Infant Mortality in 1980s"
       , y = "Average Maternal Mortality in 1980s" 
       , color = "Cluster Assignment")

```

# Tab 3: Lillian's part

Here, I am investigating how the impacts of natural disasters have changed over time since 1980 until 2020. Specifically, how has the frequency of natural disasters changed? How has the number of people killed, injured, affected, and displaced due to these disasters changed?  
To investigate this problem, take a look at the shiny app below.
